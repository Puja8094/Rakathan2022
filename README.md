## Sustainable Development



<h3> Problem Statement</h3>


The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 10% of CO2 is emitted by the Agri sector. On one hand, Agri companies have sustainable products and services to offer to the growers. On the other hand, without proper economic incentives, farmers are reluctant to adopt sustainable practices. Centralized platform business models have so far not succeeded in creating economic value for the farmers, even while the demand for a voluntary carbon market is increasing. What technologies and business models can enable financially incentivize farmers for implementing climate-smart practices? What are the ways the buyer has proof of authenticity? In what ways the participants including investors can derive economic value ?

## Features
- Farmer Registration.
- Mint NFT for Cabon Credits using Verification from IoT Data to prove sustainable farming practice is adopted.
- IoT Device data is Directly streamed to NFT for verification using Device ID and Azure IoT Hub.
- User Dashboard to view all the NFT Minted, sold, and Purchased.
- Customer/ Industries can buy NFT carbon credits to meet their ESG Goals, and remain Carbon neutral companies.
- Money in form of Cryptocurrency is directly transferred to farmers without commission and middlemen, so they can invest the money in adopting more sustainable farming methods.
